                        <p>to date, brain-machine interface (BMI) applications have been used in a variety of ways. one of the most common applications is for robotic limbs and wheelchairs. BMIs can provide real-time feedback to help people with brain restructuring, as well as directly restoring movement, mobility, and independence for those who are paralyzed or disabled. when integrated with robotic devices, BMIs can help people regain their independence. <br><br>  
                            another application of BMIs is in wireless headsets. headsets offer a non-invasive way to access BMIs. they can enhance productivity and focus for some users, and they can also help stroke survivors restore upper limb motor function.  <br><br>
                            in addition, eye tracking and semantic decoders are used for people who are unable to speak. these technologies allow individuals to communicate using eye movements or brain activity.  <br><br>
                            smartphones and smart home interfaces: through IMCS, users can manage social media apps, email, interact with virtual assistants, and utilize instant messaging services, without relying on physical capabilities. the IMC can also control home devices such as adjusting light brightness or changing TV channels.  <br><br>
                            drone technology: recent research explores the use of IMCS for military applications in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). in the future, it could enable telepathic control over swarms of UAVs. these applications demonstrate the potential of IMCS to improve the lives of people with disabilities, enhance human capabilities, and advance technology in various fields.  <br><br>
                            neuralink, a company founded by elon musk, has been developing a small brain implant called link. the implant is designed to be inserted into the brain and equipped with electrode wires that are only a few microns in size.  <br><br>
                            the primary goal of the project is to assist people with paralysis. neuralink is also working on creating a robot to assist with the implantation process. recently, neuralink has received approval from the FDA for human trials, which could start in the near future.  <br><br>
                            neurable is a company that creates headphones that interpret brain signals and optimize performance based on user feedback. their first product, enten, analyzes data and signals to optimize peak activity periods. the headphones mute notifications, activate noise cancellation, and offer personalized music recommendations.  <br><br>
                            precision neuroscience is working on implementing a brain-computer interface (BCI) using a minimally invasive approach. their layer 7 cortical interface is a thin layer of microelectrodes placed under the dura mater on the cerebral cortex, without causing any damage. this technology is designed for medical use in the treatment of neurological conditions.  <br><br>
                            synchron, a company founded by bill gates and jeff bezos, has developed a technology that reads brain signals through blood vessels. their stentrode neuroprosthetic is inserted through the jugular vein and placed near the motor cortex. this eight-millimeter flexible chip sends signals to a receiver implanted subcutaneously in the patient's chest. the external device then translates thoughts into keystrokes in real-time. synchron has received FDA approval for human clinical trials, and has already conducted trials with four patients.

                        <p>the principles of operation of brain-computer interfaces although the current neural interfaces differ in their design and approach, they all rely on the ability to detect electrical activity, which was first demonstrated in 1849 by Dubois Raymond, who discovered that nerves have the capacity to generate electrical signals. <br><br>
                            when we think or make a decision, chemical and electrical processes occur in our nervous system, which can be detected and measured. <br><br>
                            to capture this brain activity, the interface uses electrodes that are placed close to the surface of the cerebral cortex. these sensors detect changes in voltage and measure the frequency and intensity of each neural "spike" as it occurs.<br><br>
                            it's like using a microphone, but instead of hearing sound, we are sensing the electrical activity between the neurons in the brain.<br><br>
                            the electrodes of a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be positioned on the scalp, surgically inserted above or below the dura mater, or directly inserted into the brain tissue. the quality of the signals received is directly influenced by the proximity of the reader to the cerebral cortex.<br><br>
                            the collected data is then processed by specialized computer software using signal decoding techniques. this involves applying various machine learning algorithms to transform the complex datasets resulting from recording brain activity. these algorithms enable us to obtain clean data that can be analyzed and utilized in neural interfaces.

                    the Impulse lab has introduced a neural interface that allows not only to reproduce memories, but also to control them.
                    the device works like a built-in neurocomputer: it reads brain signals, transmits them to a personal memory database, and with the help of a special capsule, the user can view and even edit their memories.
                    the neural interface is compact and invisible, so it does not cause discomfort. full control. 
                    are you ready to change your mind?
